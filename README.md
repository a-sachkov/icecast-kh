# What is it?
Set of additional scripts for my radio project based on Icecast-KH/LiquidSoap but not only.

Short about you can find here (see readme files inside subdirs for full descriptions):

- cover_art_api - Python API for music base - gets artist and title as GET request, returns cover art
- icecast-kh - set of scripts to improve Icecast-KH functionality

### TODO:
What now I'm working at?

- Playlist generator for liquidsoap - you set the rules it generates playlist for whole day.
- Telegram Bot for IceCast - info about playing song, restart service, etc.
